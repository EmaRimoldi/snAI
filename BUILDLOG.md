## 2026-07-19 — Bounded AI assistant for Understand

**Shipped locally on branch `AI`:**
- A versioned policy and prompt contract for a narrow RealDoor assistant: it explains the frozen
  challenge rules, workflow, and confirmed deterministic results; it abstains on general-purpose,
  legal, cross-applicant, protected-trait, vacancy, and program-decision requests.
- Supabase `understand-chat` Edge Function with JWT authentication, input allowlisting, deterministic
  pre-gates, OpenAI Structured Outputs, citation resolution, post-generation decision-language lint,
  safe fallback answers, and metadata-only audit logging.
- Supabase migrations for `ai_request_events`: RLS enabled, browser roles denied, service-role-only
  access, and rate-limit indexes. The migrations are applied to the shared project.
- A localized floating AI launcher appears only after **Get started** and opens a right-side chat drawer
  across Profile, Understand, and Prepare. The landing stays aligned with the team’s latest design. The
  browser sends only confirmed structured fields and never names, addresses, raw OCR, filenames, URLs,
  or uploaded documents.
- A server-side arithmetic integrity gate independently recomputes source annualization, annualized total,
  the frozen household threshold, and the comparison before any model request.
- Policy/evaluation tests covering corpus hash parity, all 36 organizer QA cases, all 24 adversarial
  categories, multilingual off-domain prompts, allowlist sanitization, grounding, and decision lint.

**Deployment boundary:** the function code is ready but not deployed pending explicit authorization
for the disclosed OpenAI data transfer. Anonymous Auth is enabled and `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present in
the Supabase Edge Function secrets; only function deployment remains.

## 2026-07-18 — After-login pipeline (Profile → Understand → Prepare), demo build

**Shipped** (all new files unless noted; signed-in users now enter the pipeline):
- `frontend/lib/data/mtsp2026.ts`, `frontend/lib/data/ruleCorpus.ts` — bundled FY2026 60% MTSP
  thresholds + the frozen 11-rule corpus (from the starter pack; not the gold/eval files).
- `frontend/lib/pipeline/types.ts`, `calc.ts`, `rules.ts`, `state.tsx`, `copy.ts` — types; deterministic
  income/threshold/readiness math (integer cents, ported from `calculate.py`); rules Q&A + refusals;
  the reactive `AppStateProvider` (Status / Gross Income / Errors); localized pipeline copy.
- `frontend/lib/engine/extract.ts` — mock classify + extract behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENGINE`.
- `frontend/components/pipeline/*` — PipelineApp, GlobalValues, Stepper, ProfileStep, UnderstandStep,
  PrepareStep, DocumentPreview, and `pipeline.module.css`.
- Edited `frontend/app/page.tsx` (mount pipeline when signed in) and `CLAUDE.md §2A` (flow renamed to
  Profile → Understand → Prepare).

**Decisions / deviations (demo scope, not production):**
- **No new dependencies.** Skipped `pdfjs`/`zod` — installing onto the WSL mount from Windows fetches
  wrong-platform Next/SWC binaries. Preview = native "open document" link + a page schematic with the
  bbox highlighted (normalized coords); validation = TS types + light guards.
- **Mock engine seam.** Extraction is a deterministic mock (per-filename hash, never keyed to household
  IDs) so the demo runs standalone; teammates' real engine swaps in via `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENGINE`.
- **Client-side state.** The application record lives in React context; **Supabase Storage/Postgres
  persistence deferred** (the chosen durable store is a follow-up, not needed for the demo loop).
- **Pipeline copy** in `lib/pipeline/copy.ts` (EN complete + ES/ZH/TL/VI for visible chrome, EN
  fallback) rather than `dictionaries.ts`, to avoid churn on that actively-developed file. Fold in later.
- **CSS Modules** for pipeline components (consume the global `:root` tokens) to avoid clobbering the
  in-flight `globals.css` edits.

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` clean across all 15 new files (strict mode). **Not run:** live
click-through — the pipeline is behind login (no demo creds here) and there is no local Node toolchain
in WSL; Vercel builds on push. Run locally with `npm install && npm run dev` in `frontend/`, or push
for a Vercel preview.

**Follow-ups:** swap mock→real engine; add `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` before authenticated
Supabase calls; wire the private `documents` Storage bucket + persistence; fold `copy.ts` into
`dictionaries.ts` + `i18n_translations` and complete the longer-string translations; make the
conflict/expired/quarantine cases reliably triggerable for the live demo.

## 2026-07-19 — Progress-aware status in the header (chips), sticky header

**Shipped:** a UI-only `DisplayStatus` ladder derived from already-parsed state —
NOT_STARTED → PROCESSING → AWAITING_CONFIRMATION (n unconfirmed) → EVIDENCE_ISSUES (n blocking) →
DOCUMENTS_MISSING (informational) → READY → PACKET_LOCKED — shown as two minimal color-coded chips
(Status + Errors with a circled-! / check icon) inside the now-sticky `SiteHeader`, visible only in
the app view. `deriveDisplayStatus()`/`countUnresolved()` live in `lib/pipeline/calc.ts`;
`AppStateProvider` moved from `PipelineApp` up to `app/page.tsx` so the header shares the record;
`GlobalValues` (Status/Gross-Income/Errors cards) removed — gross income now appears only in
Understand. Copy for the new states added in all five languages (`lib/pipeline/copy.ts`).

**Decisions / deviations:**
- The exported `submission.readiness_status` remains strictly the organizer binary
  (READY_TO_REVIEW / NEEDS_REVIEW); the ladder maps down and adds no new export vocabulary.
- New `--success` token in `globals.css` (user-directed status color-coding; deviates from the
  design doc's "no success color" rule). Mitigation: color is never the only signal — each state has
  distinct text, and the error chip pairs color with a distinct icon (circled ! vs check).
- `body` `overflow-x` switched to `clip` (with `hidden` fallback) so `position: sticky` works.

**Verified:** `npm run build` clean (strict TS). Live click-through of the ladder still to be done in
the browser (upload → confirm → lock walk; delete-session → NOT_STARTED).

## 2026-07-19 — Errors chip → expandable menu; auto-advance on confirm

**Shipped:**
- The header errors chip is now a disclosure button: it expands a small menu titled "What needs
  attention" listing one entry per counted error — unconfirmed fields ("Needs your check"),
  confirmed-but-low-confidence fields, and each missing checklist document — with a one-line
  explanation. Choosing a field entry jumps straight to it in Profile (new
  `requestReviewField(id)` / `pendingReviewFieldId` in `lib/pipeline/state.tsx`, consumed by a
  `ProfileStep` effect); a missing-document entry jumps to the upload checklist. Menu closes on
  outside click and Escape (focus returned to the chip); entry count always equals the chip number.
- Confirming or saving a correction in Profile now auto-advances to the next field still needing a
  check (forward search with wrap; stays put when none remain), so reviewing a document flows
  hands-free from value to value.
- New copy keys (`errorsMenuTitle`, `errLowConfidence`) in all five languages.

**Verified:** `npm run build` clean (strict TS). Browser click-through still recommended.

## 2026-07-19 — Error semantics decoupled from confirmation; traffic-light chip

**Shipped (user-directed redefinition):**
- **Errors now = detected inconsistencies / rule flags on CONFIRMED values only** (pay-stub
  conflict, expired letter, gig corroboration) — `computeReadiness` evidence checks fire only once
  the involved fields are confirmed/corrected; `computeErrorCount(reasons)` counts blocking
  non-UNCONFIRMED reasons. Unconfirmed fields and missing documents are pending/informational,
  never errors.
- **Traffic light on the errors chip:** red (circled !) = errors found; yellow (clock icon, new
  `--warn` amber token) = no errors but values unconfirmed; green (check) = all confirmed and ok.
  Status-chip tones aligned (AWAITING/DOCUMENTS_MISSING now amber). Ladder priority flipped:
  EVIDENCE_ISSUES outranks AWAITING_CONFIRMATION (red beats yellow).
- **Menu improvements:** entries grouped errors → pending confirmations → missing documents, each
  with explanation + jump; menu is scrollable (max-height 60vh); opening focuses the first entry;
  after a jump, focus lands on the field heading in Profile.

**Note:** exported `submission.readiness_status` untouched — UNCONFIRMED_FIELDS still blocks it, so
final outcomes after full confirmation are identical to before.

## 2026-07-19 — Prepare: SAMPLE readiness receipt (paper preview, inline edit, print-to-PDF)

**Shipped:**
- New `frontend/components/pipeline/ReceiptDocument.tsx` + `receipt.module.css` — the Prepare step's
  Summary card is replaced by a stacked "paper" document (SAMPLE watermark + banner + on-document
  kicker so the flag survives print): applicant/household, documents checklist, confirmed details
  with per-row Correct (edit-in-place via `correctField`, hidden when locked; recompute cascades
  live), income calculation (annualized / FY2026 60% limit / comparison / effective date), file
  readiness (status + coded reasons + non-decisional note), and a refusal-form footer.
- "Save receipt as PDF" = `window.print()` + print isolation in `globals.css` (scoped with
  `body:has([data-print-region])` so printing pages without a receipt is untouched; the show rules
  carry the same `:has()` prefix — a bare `[data-print-region] *` loses the specificity fight and
  prints blank). "View raw data" keeps the `submission.json` `<pre>`; JSON download unchanged.
- ~18 new copy keys × all five languages; `deleteConfirm` now mentions the receipt (all five);
  removed dead `previewBtn`/`summaryTitle` keys. Supabase `i18n_translations` mirror for pipeline
  copy still follows the earlier fold-in follow-up (§14).

**Revised after user direction + code review (same day):** the receipt's data sections now mirror
the parsed-document schema — one section per uploaded document listing every expected field for its
type (`EXPECTED_DOC_FIELDS` in `ReceiptDocument.tsx`; benefit amount is a dynamic one-of across
weekly/biweekly/semimonthly/monthly/annual keys; `declared_income` optional). Values come only from
parsed fields — never invented; absent entries render red "Still missing", extracted-but-unconfirmed
ones red "Needs your check", and a document's quarantined text is flagged ("⚠ Quarantined text —
ignored") without ever rendering its content. Review fixes: lock now force-closes an in-flight
editor and gates start/save (was a HIGH: save still worked if the editor was open when lock fired);
income-tagged corrections are validated non-negative/parseable with an inline `role="alert"` error
(`invalidAmount` ×5 languages) — this also guards the pre-existing `annualizeCents` throw-on-negative
crash (no error boundary exists in the app) and the silent `toCents("garbage") → $0` coercion, on
this surface; focus returns to the row's Correct button after save/cancel; `humanize`/doc-label/
reason-text helpers extracted to `lib/pipeline/labels.ts` (were copy-pasted ×3); edit inputs capped
at `maxLength={120}`; redundant threshold double-lookup dropped.

**Simplified (user-directed, same day):** Prepare collapsed from three cards to ONE surface —
title + a plain-language intro ("Check your receipt below — correct anything marked in red…"), the
readiness chip with the lock/unlock button beside it (locked swaps the note to `lockedNote`),
reasons only when they exist, a single visible actions row (Save receipt as PDF = the one primary
button; Download packet / Edit details / View raw data secondary), then the receipt document, with
delete-with-confirm last behind a separator rule. New `prepareIntro` copy ×5; `controlsTitle`
removed (`noReasons` kept — HeaderStatus uses it); `.statusRow` added to `pipeline.module.css`.
Verified: tsc clean; one h2 on the step; print isolation intact after the restructure; 375px stacks
cleanly (remaining overflow is the pre-existing header nav).

**Split view (user-directed, same day):** Prepare is now a two-pane layout on desktop — controls
rail on the left (intro, status + lock, reasons, actions, delete), the big paper document preview
on the right at ~60% of the card (`.prepareGrid` 2fr/3fr in `pipeline.module.css`, collapses to one
column ≤960px; the rail is `position: sticky` under the sticky header so actions stay reachable
while the document scrolls). `.shell` widened 62rem → 72rem so the document truly reads as half the
screen (all steps get the wider canvas). Verified: doc pane ≈592px right-of-rail at 1440px, sticky
rail pinned at ~88px mid-scroll, mobile stacks controls→document, print still emits only the
receipt.

**Full i18n pass on Prepare (user-directed, same day):** audited every string on the step against
all five languages. Added the 17 missing keys to each of es/zh/tl/vi (`doc*` ×6, `rc_*` ×6,
`reasonsTitle`, `stExtracted`, `quarantineTitle`, `effective`, `cmpNone`, `lockedNote`, `unlockBtn`,
`deletedProof`, `noDocs`). New `FIELD_LABELS` map in `copy.ts` (25 parsed-field keys × 5 languages)
with `useFieldLabel()` in `labels.ts` (fallback language → en → humanize) — receipt rows no longer
show humanized-English keys in other languages. Reason `detail` doc names now use localized
`docLabels` instead of `humanize`. Dropped `text-transform: capitalize` on `.rowKey` (wrong for
es/vi casing; labels carry their own). Verified live in all four non-English languages (field
labels, red markers, doc sections, quarantine flag, rail) with a zero-residual-English sweep.
Still English-only elsewhere (pre-existing, outside Prepare): ProfileStep field-review headings and
`FIELD_EXPLAIN` explanations — `useFieldLabel` is ready for Profile as a follow-up.

**Brand + leaner rail (user-directed, same day):** the receipt's document header now carries the
RealDoor brand (logo.svg + name) top-right opposite the kicker/title (`.brand` in
`receipt.module.css`; prints with the page). Left rail slimmed: `prepareIntro` shortened in all five
languages ("Correct anything marked in red, then save your receipt as a PDF."), and the
`verdictNote` line dropped from the rail — the non-decisional note remains on the document's
readiness section, and `lockedNote` still appears when locked.

**Reason codes localized (user-flagged, same day):** the raw `UNCONFIRMED_FIELDS` /
`MISSING_REQUIRED_DOCUMENT`-style constants were showing untranslated in the reason lists. New
`rcTitle_*` short titles ×6 codes ×5 languages + `useReasonTitles()` in `labels.ts`; the rail shows
only the localized title, the receipt shows the localized title with the raw code demoted to a small
muted `.codeRef` (kept on the artifact — organizer evidence vocabulary; `submission.json` codes
unchanged). Verified in ES via a triggered PAY_STUB_TOTAL_CONFLICT.

**Known quirk (pre-existing, unchanged):** the DeletionProof panel in PrepareStep is unreachable —
`deleteSession()` navigates back to Profile, unmounting PrepareStep before the proof renders. Also
pre-existing: ProfileStep's correction input still lacks the numeric guard (same crash path), and
there's no route-level `error.tsx` boundary — both worth a follow-up.

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` clean; Playwright click-through (upload → confirm all → Understand →
Prepare): receipt visible by default, edit on receipt recomputes income/readiness/header chips
(gross-pay conflict fires PAY_STUB_TOTAL_CONFLICT), lock hides edit buttons, print emulation renders
the receipt alone with watermark, 320px collapses rows to one column (remaining 320px horizontal
overflow comes from the pre-existing header nav, not the receipt), ES localization + delete flow OK.
