# BUILDLOG

## 2026-07-18 — After-login pipeline (Profile → Understand → Prepare), demo build

**Shipped** (all new files unless noted; signed-in users now enter the pipeline):
- `frontend/lib/data/mtsp2026.ts`, `frontend/lib/data/ruleCorpus.ts` — bundled FY2026 60% MTSP
  thresholds + the frozen 11-rule corpus (from the starter pack; not the gold/eval files).
- `frontend/lib/pipeline/types.ts`, `calc.ts`, `rules.ts`, `state.tsx`, `copy.ts` — types; deterministic
  income/threshold/readiness math (integer cents, ported from `calculate.py`); rules Q&A + refusals;
  the reactive `AppStateProvider` (Status / Gross Income / Errors); localized pipeline copy.
- `frontend/lib/engine/extract.ts` — mock classify + extract behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENGINE`.
- `frontend/components/pipeline/*` — PipelineApp, GlobalValues, Stepper, ProfileStep, UnderstandStep,
  PrepareStep, DocumentPreview, and `pipeline.module.css`.
- Edited `frontend/app/page.tsx` (mount pipeline when signed in) and `CLAUDE.md §2A` (flow renamed to
  Profile → Understand → Prepare).

**Decisions / deviations (demo scope, not production):**
- **No new dependencies.** Skipped `pdfjs`/`zod` — installing onto the WSL mount from Windows fetches
  wrong-platform Next/SWC binaries. Preview = native "open document" link + a page schematic with the
  bbox highlighted (normalized coords); validation = TS types + light guards.
- **Mock engine seam.** Extraction is a deterministic mock (per-filename hash, never keyed to household
  IDs) so the demo runs standalone; teammates' real engine swaps in via `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENGINE`.
- **Client-side state.** The application record lives in React context; **Supabase Storage/Postgres
  persistence deferred** (the chosen durable store is a follow-up, not needed for the demo loop).
- **Pipeline copy** in `lib/pipeline/copy.ts` (EN complete + ES/ZH/TL/VI for visible chrome, EN
  fallback) rather than `dictionaries.ts`, to avoid churn on that actively-developed file. Fold in later.
- **CSS Modules** for pipeline components (consume the global `:root` tokens) to avoid clobbering the
  in-flight `globals.css` edits.

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` clean across all 15 new files (strict mode). **Not run:** live
click-through — the pipeline is behind login (no demo creds here) and there is no local Node toolchain
in WSL; Vercel builds on push. Run locally with `npm install && npm run dev` in `frontend/`, or push
for a Vercel preview.

**Follow-ups:** swap mock→real engine; add `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` before authenticated
Supabase calls; wire the private `documents` Storage bucket + persistence; fold `copy.ts` into
`dictionaries.ts` + `i18n_translations` and complete the longer-string translations; make the
conflict/expired/quarantine cases reliably triggerable for the live demo.
